### Shopping Store | Общество магазин Казахстана

#### About project

ShoppingStore is a web project, which helps users to find products that they want on their location, 
so there will be sellers and simple users. Sellers are users/shop owners that post their products on the site. 
So, the plan is to make an online shop union over Kazakhstan shops. 
Products are divided by categories and locations, though so users can get the product they want on their location.

##Finally

1. All shops in KZ
2. One Platform
3. Easy Delivery in KZ
4. Large choice of Products
