# Shopping Store init
ShoppingStore is a web project, which helps users to find products that they want on their location, so there will be sellers and simple users. Sellers are users/shop owners that post their products on the site. So, the plan is to make an online shop union over Kazakhstan shops. Products are divided by categories and locations, though so users can get the product they want on their location.
# 
There are to main users: Customers(who make orders) and Sellers (who post products)
